Microsoft has launched an Xbox Console Streaming preview that enables playing your installed Xbox One games (this isn't the Project xCloud service, to be clear) on Android devices. You'll need to be a US- or UK-based Xbox Insider on the Alpha or Alpha Skip-Ahead rings, and you'll have to own a Bluetooth-capable Xbox One Wireless Controller. If everything aligns, though, you're set -- you can squeak in a round of Gears 5 on your lunch break.</p><p>The company plans to expand the preview to other Insider rings and regions sometime in the future. It's also currently limited to native Xbox One games and not retro players hoping to relive Xbox and Xbox 360 classics. It's going to be a while before you can simply assume that your game library will be available wherever you are. This beats retreating to the living room, though, and gives Microsoft an answer to the PS4's Remote Play.</p>"

Sony will officially shut down PlayStation Vue on January 30th, 2020, following days of rumors and years of whispers about the longevity of the on-demand, OTT television service. PlayStation Vue offers a mix of live and streaming video starting at $50 a month, and it's currently used in 500,000 households in the United States, according to The Information. By comparison, Netflix has more than 158 million subscribers.</p><p>Half a million viewers is not enough to make Vue worthwhile for Sony's bottom line. Vue occupies a murky space in the streaming-TV industry, offering channel packages like a traditional cable company, but supplemented with streaming and DVR options. Sony rolled out Vue across the US in 2016, promising a streaming solution that would feel familiar to folks with cable packages, including the exorbitant price.</p><p>Nowadays, consumers know what streaming TV is. Packages don't need to mirror classic cable offerings -- in fact, it's better that they don't. Cable companies are notorious for splintering their channels into bundles, charging more for more popular stations, and jammin</p>"
